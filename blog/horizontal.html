  Gelish is excited to announce the expansion of the Foundation
  family with
  <strong>Foundation Flex Soak-Off Rubber Base Nail Gel</strong>. Gelish Foundation Flex works as <u>a base coat</u>
  with
  the Gelish adhesion you trust but it also does so much more! Use it to provide perfecting volume to
  uneven nails, conceal discolored nails, or even as a ridge-filling base coat underneath gel polish. Itâ€™s all
  possible as Gelish Foundation Flex cures with flexibility due to its rubber base.
</p>
<p>
  Created with the advanced Foundation Base adhesion,
  <strong>Gelish Foundation Flex</strong> virtually cocoons nails in its unique rubberized gel system. The bio-sourced
  light activated bonder gives nails supernatural flexibility
  making breaks and snaps a thing of the past! Foundation Flex comes in Gelish bottle for easy, no-
  fuss brush-on application.
</p>
<p>
  Made in the USA and 10-FREE, Foundation Flex is vegan, cruelty-free, fortified with Vitamin A and Biotin
  and contains a bio-sourced light-activated bonder.&nbsp;
