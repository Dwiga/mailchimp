	Gelish is excited to announce the expansion of the Foundation
family with 
	<strong>Foundation Flex Soak-Off Rubber Base Nail Gel</strong>. Gelish Foundation Flex works as <u>a base coat</u> with
the Gelish adhesion you trust but it also does so much more! Use it to provide perfecting volume to
uneven nails, conceal discolored nails, or even as a ridge-filling base coat underneath gel polish. It’s all
possible as Gelish Foundation Flex cures with flexibility due to its rubber base.
</p>
<p>
	Created with the advanced Foundation Base adhesion, 
	<strong>Gelish Foundation Flex</strong> virtually cocoons nails in its unique rubberized gel system. The bio-sourced light activated bonder gives nails supernatural flexibility
making breaks and snaps a thing of the past! Foundation Flex comes in Gelish bottle for easy, no-
fuss brush-on application.
